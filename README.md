Halogen
========

Formerly Cascade2.

### What is this thing anyways?

~~Literally an aura cascade rip off~~Reimagining of Aura Cascade for Minecraft ~~1.12~~1.13

Note: Anybody complaining that Halogen does not include numbers will be have their suggestions summarily ignored and sternly asked to play another mod.

### Design Goals

* The parts I like from Botania and Aura Cascade.
* Hard to automate, but not expensive.
* No god damn GUIs.
* No god damn numbers!!!!!!!!!1
* Myriadtail should hate it
* People that like things to be perfect and minmaxed should hate it.
* People that like Botania and Autoverse and stuff like that should like it.

Secondary goal: One commit every day.

### That sounds cool where can I find more information?
